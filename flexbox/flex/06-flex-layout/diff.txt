Here’s a more **text‑friendly rewrite** highlighting the differences simply and clearly, without technical clutter:  

***

**Font setup:**  
-  The first code loads Roboto using detailed `@font-face` sections from Google Fonts.  
-  The second code just uses a cleaner `@import` line to bring in Roboto 400/700 faster.  

**Layout style:**  
-  The first code builds the layout piece by piece — header, content, footer — all styled separately.  
-  The second code makes the whole page a flexbox (`body` as a flex container) so the layout flows naturally.  

**Header & footer:**  
-  In the first one, both header and footer have separate left and right link sections.  
-  In the second, they’re simpler — just a single flexbox with items spaced apart.  

**Main content:**  
-  The first code centers everything by hand using padding and positioning.  
-  The second centers content automatically with `align-items`, `justify-content`, and a `gap` value.  

**Links & colors:**  
-  The first uses `color: grey` and `text-decoration-line`.  
-  The second uses `color: #666` and `text-decoration: none` (shorter and more common).  

**Buttons & inputs:**  
-  Both style these similarly. The first gives buttons larger padding (10×15px); the second is a bit smaller (8×16px).  

**Lists:**  
-  The first just removes bullets.  
-  The second removes bullets PLUS resets margins/padding and lays items in a row with flex and gaps.  

**Overall:**  
-  The first CSS is longer, more old‑school, and broken into parts.  
-  The second is shorter, more “modern,” and uses flexbox everywhere for cleaner, easier layout control.
